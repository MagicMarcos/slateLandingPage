# Slate Landing Page

<p> A simple landing page for Slate </p>
<p> Hosted at https://slate-l-p.netlify.app </p>

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized: </p> 
    <ul> 
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS (floats)</li>
    </ul>

<p>A simple, responsive landing page using some good ol'fashion floats! Definitely a fun little project. Inspiration for this project came from the SLATE homepage.<p/>

<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>Through building this app, I was able to sharpen my skills with CSS floats</p>
<p> Floats can be tricky to work with sometimes, so this was definitely a fun challenge</p>

<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>The CSS can certainly be modernized and simplified </p>
